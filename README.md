# Game overcooked :rice:

Here is a an amazing couch-coop game overcooked and I simplified it to a flat perspective as follows:

The two blue circle represent the two players, you can collaborate with your partner to complete orders and earn points by selecting, processing, serving, and washing dishes.

You can experience this game by the following two ways:

## Play it by your hand

```
cd QtOvercooked
QtOvercooked.exe -l ..\overcooked\maps\level1\level1-1.txt
```

"-l" parameter is followed by the map path, you can experience different types of maps I provided in ```\overcooked\maps```

Execute the above instructions in Windows terminal and it will show the game interface.

Player1 can be controlled by ```"WASD"``` (which represent moving up, left, down, right respectively), ```"Space"``` (which represents pick up or put down items) and ```"J"``` (which represents interacting, such as cooking and washing dirty plates).

Player2 can be controlled by the direction keys on the keyboard :arrow_up: :arrow_left: :arrow_down: :arrow_right: (which represent moving up, left, down, right), ```"Enter"``` (which represents pick up or put down items) and ```"Ctrl"``` (which represents interacting, such as cooking and washing dirty plates).

The top left corner shows the current outstanding orders and scores
